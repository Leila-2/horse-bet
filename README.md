We want you to implement a small web app which can display horse betting status.

Information about distance run by horse is available from a locally running server.
Any additional visual enhancements will be a plus.

### How to run the server

`cd server && npm install && npm run start`
You can visit [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to check that the service is working correctly and inspect the data it produces.

### How to run you web application

`cd client && npm install && npm run start`
You can visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to check that web app is working correctly.

### How to run tests

`cd client && npm run test`
